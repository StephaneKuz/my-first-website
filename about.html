                              Marc CARTER qualified from Birmingham University and rapidly progressed to achieve further qualifications and
                              training which form the basis of his special interests, dental cosmetics, bonding rehabilitation and management of
                              wear. Marc works with eminent colleagues in various disciplines of dentistry to create smiles that not only look
                              naturally outstanding but also function efficiently and comprehensively.<br>
                              Marc has gained knowledge in all aspects of restorative disciplines and continues to update his knowledge with
                              international studies on a regular basis. His interests and skills have led to a focus on prosthodontic interfaces
                              and composite bonding.
